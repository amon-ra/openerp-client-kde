Did you know that you can use number input boxes like a calculator? Go to a field where you should insert a number and type <i>3+4*12</i>. Then press enter to see the result or store the form directly. In both cases you will see the result updated in the same input box. Allowed operators include: +, -, *, / and you can also use parenthesis.
